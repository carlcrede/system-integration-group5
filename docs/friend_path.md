# How to manage wishlists and invites

An authenticated user can create a wishlist. They can also invite people to this wishlist.
Users that receive the invite link can use it to accept the invite. The invites expire after 2 days.

The wishlists and invites are served by a REST API.

# How to listen to status of friends in a wishlist

The users that have joined a wishlist (the creator and whoever accepted an invite for it) can see each others statuses.
- Users are shown as `Not Registered` while they have an invite pending for the wishlist.
- Users are shown as `Offline` while they have accepted an invite for the wishlist, but are not currently looking at it.
- Users are shown as `Online` while they have accepted an invite for the wishlist and are currently looking at it.

Websockets are used to expose the status of the users. Specifically the [socket.io](https://socket.io/) implementation. [Rooms](https://socket.io/docs/v4/rooms/) are used to manage the status of users in a wishlist.
